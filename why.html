    <p>We started this website because the illegal camping law is not being enforced at Kuilei Beach. We started independently contacting the city, mayor, and police getting only temporary results with our efforts. We are realizing it's time for collective and coordinated actions to save the beach. We are hoping the website will keep all interested parties updated with the activities to save the beach. The current action is to get the City of Honolulu to patrol beach daily and enforce the illegal camping law.,  The website has a link to our petition to the city for daily enforcement of the illegal camping law at kuilei beach and we need signatures.

Using untrained eyes, it appears the illegal campers fit into several categories. Homelessness, mental illness, drug addiction, and lifestyle choices. Also Included in the illegal camper categories are the transient travelers that know about the<strong> zero enforcement of the illegal camping law at Kuilei Beach</strong>.  All of the above are leaving trash and human waste on the beach and in the ocean.  Thatâ€™s Why.</p>
    <p><strong>We Will Free the Beach!</strong></p>
